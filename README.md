# Clinic Database Management System

This project implements a **medical clinic database** using **Oracle Database** and provides a **simple interface** for managing the data through a web application built with **Python Flask**.

## Description

The database is designed to support the operations of a medical clinic, allowing the storage and management of information about patients, doctors, appointments, and medical history. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of creating and managing a relational database in Oracle, including:

- Creating tables and defining relationships between them.
- Implementing constraints (primary key, foreign key, etc.) to ensure data integrity.
- Creating stored procedures and triggers to automate certain actions at the database level.

Additionally, the application features a simple interface built with Python and Flask, which allows users to interact with the database. Through this web interface, users can:

## Features

- **View Data**: Quick access to the data in the database tables.
- **Edit Records**: Allows updating information about patients, doctors, or appointments.
- **Simple Interface**: A basic front-end, accessible via a Flask web app, that allows users to navigate and interact with the database.
