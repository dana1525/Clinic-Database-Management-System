# Clinic Database Management System

This project implements a **medical clinic database** using **Oracle Database** and provides a **simple interface** for managing the data through a web application built with **Python Flask**.

## Description

The database is designed to support the operations of a medical clinic, allowing the storage and management of information about patients, doctors, appointments, and medical history. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of creating and managing a relational database in Oracle.

Additionally, the application features a simple interface built with Python and Flask, which allows users to interact with the database. Through this web interface, users can:

## Features

- **View Data**: Quick access to the data in the database tables via HTML pages rendered through Flask.
- **Edit Records**: Allows updating information about patients, doctors, or appointments using simple HTML forms.
- **Simple Interface**: A basic front-end made with HTML and served through Flask, allowing users to navigate and interact with the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Oracle Database**: For data management and creating the database schema.
- **Python (Flask)**: For developing the web interface.
- **HTML**: For creating the user interface (HTML files are used to display the data and forms for interaction).
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the interface.
- **SQL**: For handling database operations.
